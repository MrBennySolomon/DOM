// Exercise 1: Add a click event listener to the first box element
// that logs "First box clicked" to the console when clicked
// Make the callback function that is being passed in to event listener a named function


// Exercise 2: Add a click event listener to the container element
// that logs "Container clicked" to the console when clicked
// Click on the first box and see which event listener is called first
// Make the callback functions that are being passed in to event listeners named function


// Exercise 3: Add the following code inside the first box event listener function:
// event.stopPropagation();
// Click on the first box and see which event listener is called
// Make the callback function that is being passed in to event listener of the Container a named function
// and the function that is being passed in to the event listener of the first box an anonyms function


// Exercise 4: Remove the event.stopPropagation() method from the first box element
// Make the event listener run only once


// Exercise 5: Use the removeEventListener method to remove the event listener from the first box element


// Exercise 6: Add a click event listener to the container element that logs the background-color
