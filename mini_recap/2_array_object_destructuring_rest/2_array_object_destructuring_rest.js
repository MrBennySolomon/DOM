// Example
// Get the street and city from the address object of the last 2 people
const [, ...lastTwoPeople] = data;

// ARRAY DESTRUCTURING

// Exercise 1: Use array destructuring to get the first two hobbies of the first person in the data array

// Exercise 2: Use array destructuring to get the first and third friend of the second person in the data array


// OBJECT DESTRUCTURING

// Exercise 1: Use object destructuring to get the name, age, and city of the third person in the data array

// Exercise 2: Use object destructuring to get the name and age of the first friend of the third person in the data array


// THE REST OPERATOR

// Exercise 1: Put the last two objects from the data array in a new array

// Exercise 2: Put the last friend of the first person in a new array
